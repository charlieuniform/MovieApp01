# MovieApp01
A simple static HTML movie application with optional messaging for digital screens. Great for use with charlieuniform (Coming soon, currently in Beta.)

This app displays a movie of your choice that fills the entire screen of your digital display. It optionally can show a message timed to fade in and out with the movie loop.

It is rudimentary, but serves a a demonstration of a most basic HTML web application for display on a screen via a browser in full-screen mode.
